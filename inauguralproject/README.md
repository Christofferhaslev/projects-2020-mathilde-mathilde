# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

In this inaugural project we set up an algorithm to find the optimal solution to a labor supply problem. 
We solve for the choices of consumption and labor to maximize utility for a given wage. 
We further maximize tax revenue by changing the labor income taxes and the cutoff for top labor income bracket.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
